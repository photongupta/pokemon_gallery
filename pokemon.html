            Koffing embodies toxic substances. It mixes the toxins with raw
            garbage to set off a chemical reaction that results in a terribly
            powerful poison gas. The higher the temperature, the more gas is
            concocted by this Pokémon. If Koffing becomes agitated, it raises
            the toxicity of its internal gases and jets them out from all over
            its body. This Pokémon may also overinflate its round body, then
            explode.

            Weezing alternately shrinks and inflates its twin bodies to mix
            together toxic gases inside. The more the gases are mixed, the more
            powerful the toxins become. The Pokémon also becomes more putrid.
            Weezing loves the gases given off by rotted kitchen garbage. This
            Pokémon will find a dirty, unkempt house and make it its home. At
            night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through

            Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash
            around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is
            actually a very hardy Pokémon that can survive in any body of water

            Pokémon that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This
            behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.
